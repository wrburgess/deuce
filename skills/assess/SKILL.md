# assess — Stage 1 of the lifecycle

The packaged procedure for
[Chapter 1 → Stage 1 — Assess](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-1--assess). This body
carries the verbs and links the variables; the stage itself — trigger, work, terminal artifact,
exit — is canon and is not restated here.

## When it is invoked

The HC points the AC at an issue —
[the Stage 1 trigger](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-1--assess).

## Procedure

1. **Read the issue from the tracker** — title, body, labels, and every existing comment.
2. **Set `status:in-progress`**
   ([Chapter 1 → Binding to the Work Tracking System](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#binding-to-the-work-tracking-system)).
3. **Read the stage's routing** — which model and effort runs this stage is
   [`config/models.md`](../../config/models.md); what may be offloaded, and in what shape, is
   [`config/delegation.md`](../../config/delegation.md).
4. **Research what the change would touch** — the repository as it is, not as the issue describes it.
5. **Read [`rules/authoring.md`](../../rules/authoring.md)** at the moment of writing.
6. **Draft the Assessment as a Readout** — content per
   [Stage 1](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-1--assess), shape per
   [Chapter 1 → The Readout](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-readout).
7. **Post the Assessment on the issue before proceeding on it**, carrying the rejected options and
   why they were rejected —
   [the Direction gate's floor](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-direction-gate-graduated),
   clauses 1 and 2.
8. **Hold at the Direction gate per its current setting** —
   [Chapter 1 → The Direction gate, graduated](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-direction-gate-graduated).
   The setting is read there, never from this file.

## Terminal artifact

The Assessment, posted on the issue
([Stage 1](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-1--assess)).

## When it stops and asks

On any of the four standing triggers —
[Chapter 1 → Stops](../../sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stops). The question and its answer are
recorded on the issue before the answer is acted on.

## Prior art

Re-authored from a reading of
[ace's `assess`](https://github.com/wrburgess/ace/blob/main/skills/assess/SKILL.md), per
[ADR 0006](../../adr/0006-skills-self-contained.md) — read and attributed, never vendored.
